ePDG is a gateway that allows secure communication between mobile networks (like LTE) and untrusted networks, such as public Wi-Fi or other non-cellular networks. Its main job is to create a safe connection so users can access mobile services even on untrusted networks.

Key Components:
	1.	ePDG: Acts as a security gate, setting up secure tunnels (IPSec) for data exchange between mobile devices and the core mobile network.
	2.	MME (Mobility Management Entity): Manages connections and sessions for devices on the LTE network.
	3.	S-GW (Serving Gateway): Directs and forwards data for mobile devices.
	4.	P-GW (Packet Gateway): Connects the mobile network to external internet services and enforces policies.
	5.	AAA Server: Authenticates users and ensures they have proper access permissions.
	6.	HSS (Home Subscriber Server): A database storing user profiles, locations, and network access details.
	7.	PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function): Manages network policies and tracks usage for billing.

What ePDG Does:
	•	Establishes secure tunnels using protocols like IPSec.
	•	Authenticates users via methods like EAP-AKA (a secure way to confirm identity).
	•	Routes data packets between devices and the network.
	•	Ensures smooth connectivity between Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

In short, ePDG makes it possible for your mobile phone to use cellular services securely even when connected to public Wi-Fi or other non-cellular networks, while keeping your data safe and private.
